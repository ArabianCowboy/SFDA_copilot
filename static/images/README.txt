Bot Avatar Image

Place a square image named "bot.jpg" in this directory to be used as the chatbot's avatar in the chat interface.

Recommended specifications:
- File format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 200x200 pixels
- Shape: Square (will be displayed as a circle in the UI)
- Content: SFDA logo or a robot/AI-themed image

If no image is provided, the chat interface will still work, but the avatar area will display a broken image icon.
